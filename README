KRfb
====

KRfb is a small server for the RFB protocol, better known as VNC. Unlike most 
other Unix/Linux RFB servers, KRfb (and x0rfbserver) allows you 
to share your X11 session instead of creating a new X11 session. 
It is based on x0rfbserver, available from 
http://www.hexonet.de/software/x0rfbserver/.
