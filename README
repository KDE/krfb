KDE Desktop Sharing (krfb)
==========================

KDE Desktop Sharing (krfb)  is a small server for the RFB protocol, better 
known as VNC. Unlike most other Unix/Linux RFB servers, KRfb allows you to
share your X11 session instead of creating a new X11 session. 
It was originally based on x0rfbserver 
(ttp://www.hexonet.de/software/x0rfbserver/), but there is not much code of
x0rfbserver left. Since version 0.6 it uses libvncserver 
(http://libvncserver.sf.net) as backend.
