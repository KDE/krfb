Known bugs:
- when the server closes the connection in kinetd mode krfb crashes for
  unknown reasons. (After this kinetd will not accept new connections 
  because some threads will not be killed properly, use "killall krfb")

Todo (soon):
- fix shutdown connection in kinetd nide

Todo (unscheduled features):
- SLP support (or UPnP, or whatever KDE will use)
- NAT traversal support (MIDCOM stun/turn, UPnP)
- look into adding an extension to xfree to improve speed (get noticed of
  screen updates)
