For 3.1:
- SLP support
- NAT traversal support if I can find an acceptable implementation (using DTCP, probably)

Todo (unscheduled features):
- split krfb into 2 seperate programs (server and invitation)
- user/password authentication mechanism (kerberos)?
- SSL/TLS support?
- look into adding an extension to xfree to improve speed (get noticed of
  screen updates) or maybe use the translucency extensino if finished
- cut&paste support

Known bugs/problems:
- the IP address sent in invitation may be wrong on multi-homed machines, and it
  is always incorrect behind a NAT
