For 3.2:
- write SLP service template for remote desktop protocols
  (documentation)
- enhance RFB with SASL authentication (Kerberos)
- encrypted connections (using SASL and/or SSL/TLS)
- with kerberos/ssl: display name of remote user in connection dialog,
                     kpassivepopup and systray (if name is available)
- mention that invitations are one-time on personal invitation dialog

Todo (unscheduled features):
- when krfb is started with URL arguments and without connection
  quality, add some kind of smart algorithm to determine whether the
  other host is local (maybe using SLP to announce the connectivity 
  of a LAN)
- NAT traversal support if I can find an acceptable implementation
  (probably using TURN, as soon as there is a server and newer spec for that)
- when OpenSLP supports this, allow scope configuration
- split krfb into 2 separate programs (server and invitation)
- look into adding an extension to xfree to improve speed (get noticed of
  screen updates)
- cut & paste support

Known bugs/problems:
- the IP address sent in invitation may be wrong on multi-homed machines, 
  and it is always incorrect behind a NAT. Right now it is not possible
  to solve these problems.
