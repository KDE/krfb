For 3.1:
- write SLP service template for remote desktop protocols
  (documentation)

For 3.2:
- enhance RFB with SASL authentication (Kerberos)
- encrypted connections (using SASL and/or SSL/TLS)

Todo (unscheduled features):
- NAT traversal support if I can find an acceptable implementation
  (probably using TURN, as soon as there is a server and newer spec for that)
- split krfb into 2 separate programs (server and invitation)
- look into adding an extension to xfree to improve speed (get noticed of
  screen updates)
- cut & paste support

Known bugs/problems:
- the IP address sent in invitation may be wrong on multi-homed machines, 
  and it is always incorrect behind a NAT. Right now it is not possible
  to solve these problems.
