For 3.1:
- write SLP service template for remote desktop protocols


Todo (unscheduled features):
- NAT traversal support if I can find an acceptable implementation
  (probably using STUN as described in
   draft-simu-midcom-stun-aware-nat-00.txt) 
- split krfb into 2 separate programs (server and invitation)
- user/password authentication mechanism (kerberos)?
- SSL/TLS support?
- look into adding an extension to xfree to improve speed (get noticed of
  screen updates) or maybe use the translucency extensino if finished
- cut & paste support

Known bugs/problems:
- the IP address sent in invitation may be wrong on multi-homed machines, and it
  is always incorrect behind a NAT
