Todo:
- clip framebuffer updates to requested region!
- i18n
- docs
- knotify
- kcontrol module?
- encrypted connections: http://web.mit.edu/thouis/vnc/
- do something against potential denial-of-service attacks by repeatedly
  trying to connect to users until they agree. Maybe a message box
  after the third attempt offering the user to stop KRfb, block the IP or 
  something like this
