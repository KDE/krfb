Recommended practice to debug a kinetd program
==============================================

Instead of executing your program directly, start a wrapper script that 
looks like this:

#!/bin/sh
exec xterm -e gdb --args /opt/kde/bin/krfb $1 $2

Note that you cannot use konsole because it closes the file descriptor. You need 
a very recent gdb version for the "--args" option (>= 5.2, only available as
CVS snapshot at this time).
