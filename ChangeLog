	* fixed DCOP port() call

	* added DCOP documentation
	
2002-02-20  Tim Jansen  <tjansen@tjansen.de>

	* krfb/xupdatescanner.cc: split tiles into left&right half if neccessary.

	* krfb/Makefile.am: fixed a bug for people who "make install" for the
	  first time (did not create share/krfb dir for eventrc)

	* krfb/xupdatescanner.cc: improved scanning algorithm and renamed the file. 
	  It now calculates the correct height of tiles and only joins them
	  if it wouldn't include too many unused pixels.
	  Result seems to be a reduction between 25% (web browsing) and 40% (text 
	  editing) of transmitted raw data. Note that the effectiveness of some 
	  encoders decreases with less adjacent regions, so the real reduction is 
	  probably less.

2002-02-18  Tim Jansen  <tjansen@tjansen.de>

	* released 0.6

2002-02-17  Tim Jansen  <tjansen@tjansen.de>

	* Replaced port configuration with auto-probing (because
	  changing ports is not possible with libvncserver and makes
	  too many problems anyway)

	* rfbcontroller.cc: added KNotify support

2002-02-14  Tim Jansen  <tjansen@tjansen.de>

	* integrated DCOP interface patch by Ian Reinhart 
          Geiser <geiseri@kde.org>. Thanks!

2002-02-04  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* replaced x0rfbserver's library with libvncserver

2002-01-21  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* moved read/write from RFBController to Connection

	* added some "flushing points" to remove latencies

2002-01-20  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* removed RRE encoding

2002-01-17  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* lib/encodeRectangleTight.cc: started porting Tight encoder from 
          TightVNC's winvnc

2002-01-15  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* started introducing auto_ptrs

	* removed all client stuff from the library

2002-01-14  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* lib/encodeRectangleZlib.cc: ported ZLib encoder from TightVNC's
	  winvnc server

	* lib/Makefile.am: removed CoRRE encoder from project (see NOTES)

2002-01-13  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* lib/encodeRectangleRRE.cc: ported RRE encoder from TightVNC's 
	  winvnc server

2002-01-12  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* lib/rfbServer.cc: removed throttling code as the xvncviewer
	  didn't like it and frequently crashed

2002-01-10  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* krfb/XUpdateScanner.cc: improved hints searching (join adjacent
	  hint regions, get rid of unneccessary comparisons)

2002-01-09  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* Fixed problems with closing dialogs 

	* krfb/main.cpp (main): Bugfix: better cleanup if quit is called
	  during connection dialog

2002-01-07  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* krfb/main.cpp (main): blocks SIGPIPE to avoid crashes on 
	  unexpected client death

2002-01-06  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* lib/rfbServer.cc: start to replace all standard rfblib encodings 
	  with those from TightVNC because they compress better

	* lib/encodeRectangleHextile.cc:  ported Hextile encoder from
	  TightVNC's winvnc server

	* lib/Connection.cc: reserve more space when resizing, added 
	  functions for simulated writing, delayed sending (reserve 
	  buffer, write later)

2002-01-05  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* lib/rfbServer.cc (update): removed blocks, added more sophisticated
	  Hint handling in preparation for ZLib and Tight encodings

	* lib/encodeRectangleHextile.cc:  replaced cut&paste code with macros,
	  fixed one bug (in 8 bit encoding) while doing this

	* lib/rfbServer.cc (update): fixed security bug that potentially
	  allows the client to read any the whole KRfb server memory

	* krfb/rfbcontroller.cc: fixed crash after client disconnect while
	  krfb was writing

	* lib/rfbServer.cc: fixed some bugs, avoid endlessly collecting
	  data if client doesn't take them, check input from client

2002-01-04  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* lib/rfbServer.cc: use /dev/urandom for authentication challenge 
	  if available

	* moved rfb lib directory from krfb/lib to lib 

2002-01-03  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* Changed official name to KDE Desktop Sharing

	* changed the color the icons's eyes to blue. 

	* krfb/connection-side-image.png: New side pixmap, thanks to
	  Jason Spisak (who made it) and Christopher M. Young (who sent 
	  another pixmap).

2002-01-03  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* Released 0.5.1

	* replaced kapplication.h with kapp.h for KDE versions < 2.2.2

2002-01-02  Tim Jansen  <tim@tjansen.de>

	* First release
