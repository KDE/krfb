Modes & Security
================

KRfb has 3 different security modes
- stand-alone: 
	+ traditional mode like in versions < 0.7
	+ kinetd always disabled
	+ KRfb only accepts connections from the time the user 
	  started it until he quits krfb
	+ no security restrictions (password can be empty)
- daemon/invitation only:
	+ new default since 0.7
	+ kinetd is only enabled after the user invited someone
	+ krfb only accepts invited users, all other requests will be
	  denied	
- daemon/open
	+ kinetd is always enabled
	+ a password must be set (enforced by kcontrol module, so this
          can be overidden by editing the configuration)
	+ kinetd accepts both invited and other users

- an invitation is a password that expires after a default of 60 min
- because of limitations in the Rfb protocol a connecting client must always 
  enter a password while invitations are valid, even if it is empty
