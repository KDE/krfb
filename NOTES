Comments on various aspects of KRfb:

- KRfb has been designed for three use cases:
  * a user who needs help from an administrator or friend. The adminstrator can 
    connect to the user and change settings and so on while both are talking
    on the telephone or using VoIP.
  * a user who wants to show something to a friend, so he lets his friend
    connect to his computer
  * (advanced use case) somebody with several computers, that are running
    GUIs, wants to control them.
- cases 1&2 are probably more mainstream and more important for novice users,
  so KRfb is pre-configured for them. Case 3 is for advanced users and
  therefore a little bit more difficult to configure.
- design goal of KRfb is to make it as easy to use as possible. I tried to
  limit functionality whereever possible.
- the new-connection-dialog is extra large and has the pixmap on the left
  side to capture the attention of the user before allowing a connection.
- the RFBController class is a mess. The interactions between the threaded, 
  callback-using libvncserver and the event-driven, single thread qt GUI are
  quite complicated and I can only hope that it works.
- most limitations and problems of KRfb are caused either by limitations of
  Rfb (for example no proper authentication of users, no encryption) or
  by lack of a framework in Linux in general (no way to connect through a 
  NAT device). In the next months I am going to concentrate on improving the 
  latter.
