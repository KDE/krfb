For KDE 3.0, you need to do the following:

* the .ui files must be recompiled, you can enforce this by deleting
  the following files before you build:

	krfb/configurationdialog.moc
	krfb/configurationdialog.h
	krfb/configurationdialog.cc
	krfb/newconnectiondialog.moc
	krfb/newconnectiondialog.h
	krfb/newconnectiondialog.cc

* main.cpp and trayicon.cpp include the file kapp.h. It has been renamed in
  KDE 3.0 to kapplication.h, so you must change the sources accordingly.
